Welcome to the Xahla installation guide.
Here is a step-by-step instructions for Xahla:

1. First, make sure that JDK 14 (Java Development Kit 14) is installed on your device:
If you've downloaded the complete bundle, a java/ folder at the root already contains the JDK 14.
If you've downloaded the lightweight framework (GitHub or on the main website), you'll have to download it at the following page:

2. Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your computer. Download link:

3. Launch Eclipse (must atleast be Eclipse 2020-06 for Java 14 support), and switch workspace to Xahla/workspace/ .
